# Scenic.Clock

Clock Component Scenes for use with Scenic Applications.

Provides both Analog and Digital clocks. Does depend on Timex.

This is also intended to show how to wrap up one or more components into a Hex package that other Scenic applications can reuse.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `scenic_clock` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:scenic_clock, "~> 0.11"}
  ]
end
```

Note that version v0.10 requires Scenic v0.10 or higher.

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/scenic_clock](https://hexdocs.pm/scenic_clock).
